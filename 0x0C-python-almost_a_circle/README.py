Once upon a time in the capital of Kenya, lived Eljones. He authored
this project.
The project helps achieve/understand the following concepts:
- What is Unit testing and how to implement it in a large project
- How to serialize and deserialize a Class
- How to write and read a JSON file
- What is *args and how to use it
- What is **kwargs and how to use it
- How to handle named arguments in a function

It reviews the following:
\t- imports
\t- Exceptions
\t- Classes
\t- Private attributes
\t- Geeter/Setter
\t- Class methods
\t- Static methods
\t- Inheritance
\t- unittest
\t- Read/Write file
